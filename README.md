# Thrifty Travel Planner

## Description
We created a planner website to be used as an extension to our first Thrifty Travel project. Project 1 (Thrifty Travel) was a tool to assist in picking a travel destination; Project 3 (Thrifty Travel Planner) is an application to assist in planning and booking activities. 

## Installation
This application is designed for use in a web browser.

## Usage
A user can access the website via https://planner-thrifty-travel.herokuapp.com/.
Visit the Github repo at: https://github.com/tonialtendorf/planner-thrifty-travel

## User Story
As a User I want to be able to create an account to store my profile information securely so that I can log in and access my travel planner.
As a user, I want to be able to browse and select activities so that I can plan my trip. 
As a user, I want to view my trip activities in a clear, responsive application.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a travel planner application, WHEN a user creates an account, THEN their profile and trip data is available using JWT, MongoDB, and GraphQL.
GIVEN an active login to the application, WHEN a user selects activities, THEN the activities are labeled as "added to itinerary".
GIVEN a travel planner application, WHEN the user visits the application, THEN the user has a responsive application built with React.
